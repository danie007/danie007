### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**danie007/danie007** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Securing Cyber-Physical Systems**
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Embedded C & Flutter**
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **Fun projects with Raspberry Pi**
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with **Linux Scripting**
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about **Embedded systems, Python**
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: When I was a kid, my English teacher looked my way and said, "**Name two pronouns.**" I said, "*Who?*, *Me?*"
- âš¡ Fun fact: There's no **Cloud**, it's just **Someone else's computer**
